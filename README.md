# Video-anomaly-detection-using-MRF
This research concentrates on video abnormality detection utilizing Markov Random Fields (MRFs) with a tinge of autoencoders. The image segmentation model makes full use of MRFs to effectively detect spatial-temporal anomalies. The combination of MRF and autoencoders brings a more complete representation for the video content, which will then enable abnormal activities to be detected. Through extensive testing on a variety of video datasets, the proposed approach shows superior performance in anomaly detection to state-of-the-art methods.
